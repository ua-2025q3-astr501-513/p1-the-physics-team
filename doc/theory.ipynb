    "Oftentimes probability distributions are difficult to analytically express or normalize. However, it is still possible to sample over the entire distribution given the ratio of the probabilities between two points. Starting at some initial point $\\vec{q_i}$, we can randomly draw a new value $\\vec{q_{try}}$ and define this ratio as the probability to accept $\\vec{q_{try}}$ as the new starting point:\n",

    "# Hamiltonian Monte Carlo\n",

    "HMC works by treating the probability distribution as related to the energy. The main advantage of this definition is that Hamiltonian paths conserve energy, which implies that the probability is also conserved. This allows us to accept the new step for every try, preventing the chain from getting stuck where the acceptance rate would otherwise drop to zero. For systems with a large number of parameters, this is especially useful.\n",

    "The Hamiltonian is then defined with position $q$, momentum $p$, and mass $m$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(q,p) = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(q), V(q) = -lnP(q)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we begin with initial position and momentum $(q_i,p_i)$, then $p_{try}$ will be selected with a Gaussian random draw with variance equal to mass $m$. $q_{try}$ and $p_{try}$ can then be obtained by numerically integrating Hamilton's equations:\n",

    "## Leapfrog Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that integrators do not perfectly conserve energy, so a symplectic integrator must be carefully selected to prevent any systematic drift in energy. The acceptance probability then becomes:\n",

    "$$P_{accept} = min(1, e^{-\\Delta H})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta H$ is simply the difference in energy between $q_{try}$ and the previous point. We specifically choose to implement the Leapfrog algorithm.\n",
