    "Oftentimes, probability distributions are difficult to express or normalize analytically. However, it is still possible to sample over the entire distribution given the ratio of the probabilities between two points. Starting at some initial point $\\vec{q_i}$, we can randomly draw a new value $\\vec{q_{try}}$ and define this ratio as the probability to accept $\\vec{q_{try}}$ as the new starting point:\n",
    "$$P_{\\rm accept} = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{P(\\vec{q_{\\rm try}})}{P(\\vec{q_{i}})}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic method of implementing this is the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm. To get $\\vec{q_{try}}$, the MH algorithm simply draws from a Gaussian with a mean of $\\vec{q_i}$. This algorithm, though simple, works very well on problems where $\\vec{q}$ has a small number of dimensions. However, as $\\vec{q}$ grows in size, the chance that $P(\\vec{q_{\\rm try}}) > P(\\vec{q_{i}})$ gets very small. As a result, $P_{\\rm accept}$ drops to nearly zero, and the algorithm takes a very long time to converge. To fix this, we must modify our method of drawing $\\vec{q_{try}}$ to keep $P_{\\rm accept}$ as large as possible."

    "Let's start with the crazy first step of doubling the number of parameters we have, and sampling from $P(\\vec{q}, \\vec{p})=P(\\vec{q})P(\\vec{p})$. The key idea here is that we can choose $\\vec{p}$ to be independent of $\\vec{q}$, and we can choose what $P(\\vec{p})$ looks like. In most cases, we will choose a Gaussian.\n",
