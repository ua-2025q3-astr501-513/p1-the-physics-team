## How to install 
*    To install, clone this repository by doing `git clone https://github.com/ua-2025q3-astr501-513/p1-the-physics-team.git` and then `pip install -e .`.
     ```

## Required dependencies
*    JAX: `pip install --upgrade "jax[cpu]"`
*    Numpy: `pip install numpy`
*    Matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`
*    Plotting tools from getdist: `pip install getdist`
*    If using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, please add a `!` before every `pip`.

## How to run
For getting started, we suggest looking at the [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ua-2025q3-astr501-513/p1-the-physics-team/blob/main/doc/theory.ipynb).

Welcome to the repository of the **Mid-Term Project** for ASTR 513.
This project is worth **20 points** and gives you the opportunity to
apply the numerical techniques we have covered in the course so far.

You are recommended to work in teams of 3 to 6 students.
To form a team, come up with a unique team name and put it in this
[GitHub Classroom link](https://classroom.github.com/a/nqfiwWTG).

## Timeline & Deliverables

* Presentation dates:
  October 13th or 15th
* Submission deadline:
  By 11:59 pm (Arizona time) on the day of your presentation
* Submission platform: GitHub Classroom

Your final submission should include:

* Project code (inside the `src/` directory of this git repository)
* Documentation (inside the `doc/` directory)
* Presentation materials (slides or Jupyter notebook, also version
  controlled with this git repository)

Only **one submission per team** is needed.

**Late submissions may not be accepted. Please plan.**

## Project Ideas

The file `doc/ideas.yaml` contains a compilation of topics from
homework set \#1.
Please use this list to help you look for other students with similar
interests and form teams.

Example from a past project:
[Exoplanet Statistics](https://github.com/ua-2024q3-astr513/ASTRSTATS513_final).

## Requirements

### 1. Code

* Submit well-documented, runnable source code.
* Include docstrings and inline comments.
* Update this `README.md` file to explain:
  * How to install and run your project
  * Any dependencies or data required

### 2. Presentation

* Deliver a ~ 15-minute presentation on your project.
* You may use either:
  * Slides (traditional format), or
  * A Jupyter notebook (similar to our class style).

Your presentation should:
* clearly explain the problem you tackled;
* show the numerical techniques you applied;
* present results with relevant plots, tables, or figures
* highlight your findings and insights.

Each team member should be prepared to discuss their contributions.

## Grading (20 points total)

Projects will be graded based on the following criteria:
1. Originality & clarity of the idea
2. Quality of the solution (numerical methods, implementation,
   correctness)
3. Thoroughness of documentation (code comments, docstrings, README)
4. Effectiveness of presentation (clarity, structure, visualizations,
   teamwork)

## Collaboration & GitHub Use

Projects are managed through GitHub Classroom.
* Multiple students can share a single repository.
  You can join by putting your unique team name in this
  [GitHub Classroom link](https://classroom.github.com/a/nqfiwWTG).
* Use GitHub to track progress, manage code, and collaborate.
* Only one final submission per team is needed.

## Final Note

This project is your chance to be creative, apply what you have
learned so far, and work collaboratively on a meaningful computational
astrophysics problem.
We look forward to your results!
